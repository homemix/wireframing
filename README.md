# Wireframing

## Introduction
**Wireframing** is a crucial step in the design process that involves creating a visual guide or blueprint representing the layout and structure of a digital product such as a website, mobile app, or software interface. It helps designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize how the product will function and how users will interact with it before any actual coding or design begins.

## Importance of Wireframing
Wireframes serve as the foundation of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design. They are typically low-fidelity sketches or digital outlines that focus on functionality, layout, and navigation rather than colors or graphics.

### Key Benefits
- **Clarifies structure and flow:** Helps identify how pages, screens, or features connect.
- **Improves communication:** Aligns designers, developers, and stakeholders early in the design phase.
- **Saves time and cost:** Detects usability or layout issues before development begins.
- **Supports user-centered design:** Ensures user needs are considered at every stage.

## Summary
Wireframing bridges the gap between ideas and actual design.  
It provides a clear visual roadmap for development, ensuring that both functionality and user experience are thoughtfully planned from the start.
